# Advanced Machine Learning - Introdution to Deep Learning

# Week 1
**1) Program Assignment**
     -  Predict tags on StackOverflow with linear models
     - In this assignment you will learn how to predict tags for posts from StackOverflow. To solve this task you will use multilabel classification approach.

**2) Goals of the week**
- Train a linear model for classification or regression task using stochastic gradient descent
- Tune SGD optimization using different techniques
- Apply regularization to train better models
- Use linear models for classification and regression tasks

# Week 2
**1) Program Assignment**
- In this assignment, you will use a recurrent neural network to solve Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. NER is a common task in natural language processing systems. It serves for extraction such entities from the text as persons, organizations, locations, etc. In this task you will experiment to recognize named entities from Twitter.


**2) Goals of the week:**
- Build LSTM model for named entities recognition
- Distinguish n-gram and RNN language models
- Give examples of smoothing techniques in language modeling
- Propose and compare approaches for sequence tagging tasks


# Week 3

**1) Program Assignment**
- In this assignment you will learn how to calculate a similarity for pieces of text. Using this approach you will know how to find duplicate questions from StackOverflow.
   
**2) Goals of the week**
- Interpret word2vec and other word embedding techniques
- Build a ranking system based on sentence embeddings
- Summarize applications of topic modeling
- Describe how to train a topic model only from texts

# Week 4

**1) Program Assignment**
- In this assignment, you will learn how to use neural networks to solve sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks. Seq2Seq models are very popular these days because they achieve great results in Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Conversational Modeling and more.

- Using sequence-to-sequence modeling you are going to build a calculator for evaluating arithmetic expressions, by taking an equation as an input to the neural network and producing an answer as it's output.
   
**2) Goals of the week**

- Recognize sequence to sequence tasks in NLP and judge on appropriate architectures
- Describe traditional pipeline in machine translation
- Train seq2seq neural networks for applied tasks
- Explain attention mechanism in neural networks



# Week 5
**1) Program Assignment**
- You will implement a conversational bot that will assist with search on StackOverflow.
   
**2) Goals of the week**

- Develop a chat-bot that answers intended questions and holds a conversation
- Understand the architecture of task-oriented dialog systems
- Understand how NLU and DM can be implemented
- Understand how neural networks can help to train better NLU and DM
